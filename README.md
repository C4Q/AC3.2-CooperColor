Dependency Injection:

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows for a layer of abstraction between the client side and the server side. In this case, the API server is the dependency and my app is the dependent. Dependency injection helps increase the usability of the code you're making.

In the Cooper Color code, the dependency injection we made was the JSONParser.
